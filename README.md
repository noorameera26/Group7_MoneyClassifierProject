### Can a computer classify your Ringgits?                                                                                                

To fulfill the requirements for the CDLE training program conducted by CertifAI and Skymind, me and my partner developed a CNN model to classify Malaysian Banknotes.

Our project objectives were short and simple which are:
- to develop an image classification model that supports 6 classes.
- to use the available VGG16 API and apply Transfer Learning.
- to prepare and process the datasets.
- to create an image classifier that classifies Malaysian Ringgit.

The datasets used for this project is obtained in courtesy of the researchers from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia which was used in their research published in 2012. [1]
